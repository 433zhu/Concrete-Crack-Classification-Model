# Concrete Crack Classification with Tensorflow Keras API

The dataset with all the images used in this project was downloaded from Mendeley Data:

Using the Tensorflow Keras API, a Convolutional Neural Network model was trained on the scaled down images of concrete labeled as "Positive" or "Negative" for concrete surfaces with a crack or not.
